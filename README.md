## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Given the bento grid cards had a lot of variation in things like background colors, font sizes, and padding, this was a great use case for implementing custom variables with default fallbacks. It's an approach I haven't used too often so I was happy to practice it here.

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's Bento Grid Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4dHvo09cG4) - Full disclosure, Kevin Powell has an excellent (as usual) video tutorial for this project, tackling the layout challenges and creating reusable custom variables. Much of my solution is inspired by his approach with some tweaks here and there. 
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
